I wanted to make a simple code to spam people on any plateform without providing credentials or any extra work. You just have to put your cursor where you want to type the messages and then run the code and enjoy.

Unfortunately, the email spam code doesn't work anymore as Google disabled smtp emails. Now, they are only allowed if strong authentification methods are put in place for security reasons ( which you can do with a bit of work and a slight code modification if you really wanna spam people ;) ).
